We compared the standalone and parallel approaches for this method. Both approaches include three main steps: pattern extraction, trajectory clustering, and blind zone detection. The Sample Data section contains the required example data. This includes:

gps.csv: GPS positioning data from 20 buses operating for one day.

bus_line.csv: Bus line data.

lines95_parameter.csv: Two parameters used for trajectory clustering.
